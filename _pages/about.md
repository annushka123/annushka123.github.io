I am a violinist, composer, improviser and music technologist. I create works which integrate improvised and composed music with cross-media platforms such as Max/MSP/Jitter, P5.js and Ableton Live in collaboration with multidisciplinary artists.

I completed an MFA in Integrated Composition, Improvisation and Technology at the University of California, Irvine in 2016. I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Jazz Performance from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and a Bachelor’s degree in Classical Performance from the Australian Institute of Music.

I am currently based in Atlanta, Georgia, focusing on expanding my knowledge in creative computing and hardware design in order to pursue a Doctorate program in 2022.

## A little bit about me
Personally

I am a wife and a mom of two incredible little girls. My family is my greatest source of inspiration.
My husband, Richard Savery, and I met at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, while doing a bachelor's degree in Jazz performance. Since then, we've had over a decade worth of adventures that helped mould us into the kinds of artists we strive to be.
